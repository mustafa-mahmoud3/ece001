<h1>Big Data</h1>
<h2>Why Big Data?</h2>

<p>Current use of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analyzes, or some other advanced data analytics method that extracts value from data, and rarely reaches a specific size from the data set. The amounts of data currently available are really large, but this is not the most relevant feature of this new environmental data system, and data sets analysis can find new connections to identify business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime, etc.
